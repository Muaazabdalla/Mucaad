				This initial peace was shattered by fighting between rival SNM factions in the towns of Burao and Berbera in 1992.  Hundreds of women demonstrated for peace, at times putting themselves between the fighters, donning white mourning scarves, marching, and singing.

			<h2>mohamed cabdi maxamed [a] officially the Republic of Somaliland,[b] is an unrecognised sovereign state in the Horn of Africa, recognised internationally as a de jure autonomous region of Somalia.[11][12][13]

Its located on the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden.[14][15][16] It is bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Ethiopia to the south and west, and Somalia to the east.[17][18][19][20] Its claimed territory has an area of 176,120 square kilometres (68,000 sq mi),[21] with approximately 5.7 million residents as of 2021.[7] The capital and largest city is Hargeisa. The government of Somaliland regards itself as the successor state to British Somaliland, which, as the briefly independent State of Somaliland, united from 1960 to 1991 with the Trust Territory of Somaliland (the former Italian Somaliland) to form the Somali Republic.[22]

The area of Somaliland was inhabited around 10,000 years ago during the Neolithic age.[23][24] The ancient shepherds raised cows and other livestock and created vibrant rock art paintings.[citation needed] Throughout the Middle Ages, Arab immigrants arrived in Somaliland, including the Muslim sheikhs Ishaaq bin Ahmed, who founded the Isaaq ethnic group, who travelled from Arabia to Somaliland and married into the local people.[25] Also during the Middle Ages, Somali empires dominated the regional trade, including the Sultanate of Ifat and the Adal Sultanate.

In the 18th century, the Isaaq Sultanate, a Somali successor state to the Adal Sultanate, was established by Sultan Guled Abdi at Toon.[26] The sultanate spanned parts of the Horn of Africa and covered most of modern-day Somaliland.[27][28] It had a robust economy and trade was significant at its main port of Berbera and the smaller port town of Bulhar, as well as eastwards at the frankincense-exporting port towns of Heis, Karin, and El-Darad.[29][30]

In the late 19th century, the United Kingdom signed agreements with the Habr Awal, Garhajis, Habr Je'lo, Warsangeli, Issa and Gadabuursi tribes establishing a protectorate.[31][32][33][34]

The Dervishes led by Muhammad Abdullah Hassan were against the protection agreements signed with Britain with the Somali sultans. After a span of 20 years, the Dervishes were finally defeated in one of the first aerial bombardments in Africa in 1920 Somaliland Campaign.[35] A fringe minority clan, the Dhulbahante, who did not sign a treaty of protection with the British (due to the fact that the Italians considered part of the Dhulbahante as subjects of the Italian-protected Sultan of the Majeerteen clan)[36] were the foremost proponents of the movement.[37][38]

On 26 June 1960, the protectorate gained independence as the State of Somaliland, before five days later voluntarily uniting with the Trust Territory of Somaliland, following its separate independence, to form the Somali Republic. A lawful union occurred between the two territories through their elected representatives.[39] On 27 June 1960, the Legislative Assembly of Somaliland unanimously enacted an Act of Union with Somalia which stated that the two entities would forever remain united.[40]
The most popular and used payment system in the country is the ZAAD service which is a mobile money transfer service that was launched in Somaliland in 2009 by the largest mobile operator Telesom.[249][250]

Telecommunications
Main article: Telecommunications in Somaliland
Telecommunications companies serving Somaliland include Telesom,[251] Somtel, Telcom and NationLink.[252]

The state-run Somaliland National TV is the main national public service television channel, and was launched in 2005. Its radio counterpart is Radio Hargeisa.

Agriculture
See also: Agriculture in Somaliland

Livestock export in Berbera, Somaliland
Livestock is the backbone of Somaliland's economy. Sheep, camels, and cattle are shipped from the Berbera port and sent to Gulf Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia.[253] The country is home to some of the largest livestock markets, known in Somali as seylad, in the Horn of Africa, with as many as 10,000 heads of sheep and goats sold daily in the markets of Burao and Yirowe, many of whom shipped to Gulf states via the port of Berbera.[254][255] The markets handle livestock from all over the Horn of Africa.[256]

Agriculture is generally considered to be a potentially successful industry, especially in the production of cereals and horticulture. Mining also has potential, though simple quarrying represents the extent of current operations, despite the presence of diverse quantities of mineral deposits.[52]

Tourism
Main article: Tourism in Somaliland

Naasa Hablood, also known as Virgin's Breast Mountain
The rock art and caves at Laas Geel, situated on the outskirts of Hargeisa, are a popular local tourist attraction. Totaling ten caves, they were discovered by a French archaeological team in 2002 and are believed to date back around 5,000 years. The government and locals keep the cave paintings safe and only a restricted number of tourists are allowed entry.[257] Other notable sights include the Freedom Arch in Hargeisa and the War Memorial in the city centre. Natural attractions are very common around the region. The Naasa Hablood are twin hills located on the outskirts of Hargeisa that Somalis in the region consider to be a majestic natural landmark.[258][failed verification]

The Ministry of Tourism has also encouraged travellers to visit historic towns and cities in Somaliland. The historic town of Sheekh is located near Berbera and is home to old British colonial buildings that have remained untouched for over forty years. Berbera also houses historic and impressive Ottoman architectural buildings. Another equally famous historic city is Zeila. Zeila was once part of the Ottoman Empire, a dependency of Yemen and Egypt and a major trade city during the 19th century. The city has been visited for its old colonial landmarks, offshore mangroves and coral reefs, towering cliffs, and beach. The nomadic culture of Somaliland has also attracted tourists. Most nomads live in the countryside.[258]

Transport
See also: Hargeisa Airport and Berbera Airport

The Berbera Airport
Bus services operate in Hargeisa, Burao, Gabiley, Berbera and Borama. There are also road transportation services between the major towns and adjacent villages, which are operated by different types of vehicles. Among these are taxis, four-wheel drives, minibuses and light goods vehicles (LGV).[259]

The most prominent airlines serving Somaliland is Daallo Airlines, a Somali-owned private carrier with regular international flights that emerged after Somali Airlines ceased operations. African Express Airways and Ethiopian Airlines also fly from airports in Somaliland to Djibouti City, Addis Ababa, Dubai and Jeddah, and offer flights for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages via the Egal International Airport in Hargeisa. Other major airports in the region include the Berbera Airport.[260][261]

Ports
Main articles: Port of Berbera and DP World Berbera New Port

DP World Berbera New Port
In June 2016, the Somaliland government signed an agreement with DP World to manage the strategic port of Berbera with the aim of enhancing productive capacity and acting as an alternative port for landlocked Ethiopia.[262][263]

Oil exploration
In 1958 the first test well was dug by Standard Vacuum (Exxon Mobil and Shell) in Dhagax Shabeel, Saaxil region. These wells were selected without field data or seismic testing and were solely based on the geological makeup of the region. Three of the four test wells were successful in producing of light crude oil.[264]

In August 2012, the Somaliland government awarded Genel Energy a license to explore oil within its territory. Results of a surface seep study completed early in 2015 confirmed the outstanding potential offered in the SL-10B, SL-13, and Oodweyne blocks, with estimated oil reserves of 1 billion barrels each.[265] Genel Energy is set to drill an exploration well for SL-10B and SL-13 block in Buur-Dhaab, 20 kilometers northwest of Aynaba by the end of 2018.[266] In December 2021, Genel Energy signed a farm-out deal with OPIC Somaliland Corporation, backed by Taiwan's CPC Corporation, on the SL10B/13 block neary Aynaba.[267] According to Genel, the block could contain more than 5 billion barrels of prospective resources.[267] Drilling in SL-10B and SL-13 is scheduled to begin in late 2023, or early 2024 according to Genel.[268]

There has not been an official census conducted in Somaliland since the Somalia census in 1975, while the results from a 1986 census were never released into public domain.[273] A population estimate was conducted by UNFPA in 2014 primarily for the purpose of distributing United Nations funding amongst the regions and to offer a reliable population estimate in lieu of a census. This population estimate puts the combined population of the regions of Somaliland at 3.5 million.[274] The Somaliland government estimates that there are 5.7 million residents as of 2021.[7]

The last British population estimate on the basis of clan in Somaliland occurred before independence in 1960,[275] according to which, out of some 650,000 ethnic Somalis belonging to three major clans residing in the protectorate, the Isaaq, Darod and Dir made up 66%, 19% and 16% of the population, respectively.[276][277]


Map indicating clan territories and respective populations in the 1950s.[278]
The largest clan family in Somaliland is the Isaaq,[279] making up 80% of the population.[280][281][282] The populations of the five largest cities in Somaliland – Hargeisa, Burao, Berbera, Erigavo and Gabiley – are predominantly Isaaq.[283][284] The second largest clan is the Gadabursi of the Dir clan[285][286][287] followed by the Harti of the Darod.[288] Other small clans are often not accounted for in such estimates, however, clans including Gabooye, Gahayle, Jibrahil, Magaadle, Fiqishini, and Akisho settle in Somaliland.

Somaliland in addition has an estimated 600,000[289] to a million[290] strong diaspora, mainly residing in Western Europe, the Middle East, North America, and several other African countries.[289][290]

Clan groups
The Gadabursi subclan of the Dir are the predominant clan of the Awdal region,[291][292] where there is also a sizeable minority of the Issa subclan of the Dir who mainly inhabit the Zeila district.[293]

The Habr Awal subclan of the Isaaq form the majority of the population living in both the northern and western portions of the Maroodi Jeex region, including the cities and towns of northern Hargeisa, Berbera, Gabiley, Madheera, Wajaale, Arabsiyo, Bulhar and Kalabaydh. The Habr Awal also have a strong presence in the Saaxil region as well, principally around the city of Berbera and the town of Sheikh.

The Arap subclan of the Isaaq predominantly live in the southern portion of </h2>

In the example above, the HTML
 code includes tags for the header,
 main, and footer sections, as well 
as a section for the photo. The "img" 
tag is used to insert the image, and the
 "src" attribute specifies the location and
 name of the image file. The "alt" attribute
 provides a description of the image for accessibility purposes.

To style the page, you can create a separate 
CSS file and link it to the HTML document using 
the "link" tag in the head section. Here is an 
example of a CSS code for the page:


body {
	font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

header {
	background-color: #333;
	color: #fff;
	padding: 20px;
}

nav ul {
	list-style: none;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}

nav li {
	display: inline-block;
	margin-right: 20px;
}

nav a {
	color: #fff;

	height: auto;}


In the CSS code above, the "body" tag sets 
the font family for the page, while the "header" 
tag sets the background color and text color for 
the header section. The "nav" tag styles the navigation
 links, while the "main" tag sets the margin for the main
 section of the page. Finally, the "img" tag sets the
 maximum width for the image and ensures
 that it scales proportionally.
