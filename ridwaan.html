			<ul>In contrast to south and central Somalia, the self-declared Republic of Somaliland in the northwest has enjoyed relative stability.  Somaliland declared independence in May 1991, with a rebuilt Hargeisa as its capital.  Although its sovereignty remains unrecognized by the international community, the people of Somaliland have undertaken to build a functioning parliamentary democracy.

				In 1991, Barre was driven out of the southern capital of Mogadishu, effectively marking the end of military rule. That same year, the Isaaq-majority Somali National Movement (SNM) called a conference of clan elders in Burao, ending hostilities in the northwest, establishing a framework for peaceful coexistence between the Isaaq, Dir, and Darod clans in the region, and declaring independence from the south.
				
				This initial peace was shattered by fighting between rival SNM factions in the towns of Burao and Berbera in 1992.  Hundreds of women demonstrated for peace, at times putting themselves between the fighters, donning white mourning scarves, marching, and singing. By 1993, elders from the major clans and subclans met at Boroma for the historic Grand Conference of National Reconciliation, and, after four months of negotiations, adopted a transitional national charter which served as a temporary constitution.  Among the achievements of the conference at Boroma was the creation of a blueprint for a parliament comprising two houses: a non-elected house of clan elders and an elected house of representatives.  The Republic was thus established on the relatively strong local community structures that had been a continuous presence in the region since the days of British rule. (See I.M.

            <h2>History of somaliland Telecommunications
                Main article: Telecommunications in Somaliland
                Telecommunications companies serving Somaliland include Telesom,[251] Somtel, Telcom and NationLink.[252]
                
                The state-run Somaliland National TV is the main national public service television channel, and was launched in 2005. Its radio counterpart is Radio Hargeisa.
                
                Agriculture
                See also: Agriculture in Somaliland
                
                Livestock export in Berbera, Somaliland
                Livestock is the backbone of Somaliland's economy. Sheep, camels, and cattle are shipped from the Berbera port and sent to Gulf Arab countries, such as Saudi Arabia.[253] The country is home to some of the largest livestock markets, known in Somali as seylad, in the Horn of Africa, with as many as 10,000 heads of sheep and goats sold daily in the markets of Burao and Yirowe, many of whom shipped to Gulf states via the port of Berbera.[254][255] The markets handle livestock from all over the Horn of Africa.[256]
                
                Agriculture is generally considered to be a potentially successful industry, especially in the production of cereals and horticulture. Mining also has potential, though simple quarrying represents the extent of current operations, despite the presence of diverse quantities of mineral deposits.[52]
                
                Tourism
                Main article: Tourism in Somaliland
                
                Naasa Hablood, also known as Virgin's Breast Mountain
                The rock art and caves at Laas Geel, situated on the outskirts of Hargeisa, are a popular local tourist attraction. Totaling ten caves, they were discovered by a French archaeological team in 2002 and are believed to date back around 5,000 years. The government and locals keep the cave paintings safe and only a restricted number of tourists are allowed entry.[257] Other notable sights include the Freedom Arch in Hargeisa and the War Memorial in the city centre. Natural attractions are very common around the region. The Naasa Hablood are twin hills located on the outskirts of Hargeisa that Somalis in the region consider to be a majestic natural landmark.[258][failed verification]
                
                The Ministry of Tourism has also encouraged travellers to visit historic towns and cities in Somaliland. The historic town of Sheekh is located near Berbera and is home to old British colonial buildings that have remained untouched for over forty years. Berbera also houses historic and impressive Ottoman architectural buildings. Another equally famous historic city is Zeila. Zeila was once part of the Ottoman Empire, a dependency of Yemen and Egypt and a major trade city during the 19th century. The city has been visited for its old colonial landmarks, offshore mangroves and coral reefs, towering cliffs, and beach. The nomadic culture of Somaliland has also attracted tourists. Most nomads live in the countryside.[258]
                
                Transport
                See also: Hargeisa Airport and Berbera Airport
                
                The Berbera Airport
                Bus services operate in Hargeisa, Burao, Gabiley, Berbera and Borama. There are also road transportation services between the major towns and adjacent villages, which are operated by different types of vehicles. Among these are taxis, four-wheel drives, minibuses and light goods vehicles (LGV).[259]
                
                The most prominent airlines serving Somaliland is Daallo Airlines, a Somali-owned private carrier with regular international flights that emerged after Somali Airlines ceased operations. African Express Airways and Ethiopian Airlines also fly from airports in Somaliland to Djibouti City, Addis Ababa, Dubai and Jeddah, and offer flights for the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages via the Egal International Airport in Hargeisa. Other major airports in the region include the Berbera Airport.[260][261]
                
                Ports
                Main articles: Port of Berbera and DP World Berbera New Port
                
                DP World Berbera New Port
                In June 2016, the Somaliland government signed an agreement with DP World to manage the strategic port of Berbera with the aim of enhancing productive capacity and acting as an alternative port for landlocked Ethiopia.[262][263]
                
                Oil exploration
                In 1958 the first test well was dug by Standard Vacuum (Exxon Mobil and Shell) in Dhagax Shabeel, Saaxil region. These wells were selected without field data or seismic testing and were solely based on the geological makeup of the region. Three of the four test wells were successful in producing of light crude oil.[264]
                
                In August 2012, the Somaliland government awarded Genel Energy a license to explore oil within its territory. Results of a surface seep study completed early in 2015 confirmed the outstanding potential offered in the SL-10B, SL-13, and Oodweyne blocks, with estimated oil reserves of 1 billion barrels each.[265] Genel Energy is set to drill an exploration well for SL-10B and SL-13 block in Buur-Dhaab, 20 kilometers northwest of Aynaba by the end of 2018.[266] In December 2021, Genel Energy signed a farm-out deal with OPIC Somaliland Corporation, backed by Taiwan's CPC Corporation, on the SL10B/13 block neary Aynaba.[267] According to Genel, the block could contain more than 5 billion barrels of prospective resources.[267] Drilling in SL-10B and SL-13 is scheduled to begin in late 2023, or early 2024 according to Genel.[268]
